### What I learned

In this challenge, I practiced my HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript skills. The main challenge for me was building the interactive sidebar menu on the mobile version using JavaScript. Composing the layout with CSS Grid and translating it to the mobile was also a challenging task. As a new learning experience, I was able to practice creating CSS Grid designs a lot, besides practicing class manipulation with JavaScript.

Most of the page's layout was built using CSS Grid, with some small Flexbox components. Absolute positioning was used to create the menu sidebar and a fading animation was added to showing the menu after pressing the open menu button.

The JS script was considerably short, consisting of adding a class to some HTML elements in order to show the mobile navigation menu, after the open button action was triggered by a click event on the menu icon. Then, a click on the close menu button triggers an event to remove the class that displays the menu from the HTML elements.
